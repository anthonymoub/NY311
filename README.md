# NY311 Complaint Predictor
The NYC311 service is an important resource for New York City residents, providing a centralized platform for citizens to report non-emergency issues and request city services. The purpose of this capstone project, which was part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate, was to analyze the top complaints received by NYC311. The analysis aimed to investigate the temporal and geospatial distribution of these complaints and identify the possible contributors of each complaint type. The project utilized basic neural network models to predict these complaints.

The project's goal was to provide valuable insights into the nature and causes of the top complaints received by NYC311. By gaining a deeper understanding of the complaints and their contributing factors, the project aimed to contribute to the development of effective strategies for addressing them.
